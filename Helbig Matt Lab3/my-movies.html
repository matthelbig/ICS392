	I chose <strong>"Helvetica"</strong> as one of my movies because it explores people's relationships with type. Everything around you was made or designed at some point by a person. The film is directed by <a href="https://twitter.com/gary_hustwit">Gary Hustwit</a>. His other films also try to look at how people change things and vice versa. His films really make you look at what is around you and think about where things come from. Looking something simple like a font or typeface can change how we feel and the message of words.

</p>

<p>
	Another Hustwit documentary, <strong>"Urbanized"</strong> lookis at how cities can change us. In the film, we see the positive and negatives of city life. It's really interesting to see how something like transportation and even lighting play a large role in people's lives.
</p>

<p>
	I picked <strong>"Fixation"</strong> because it is a well-shot primer to the world of fixed gear bikes. While there is not much depth of information, it's a good view into the world of biking.
</p>

<p>
	Lasty, I chose <strong>"TPB AFK"</strong>. This film documents some of the history of The Pirate Bay. While I don't do very much torrenting, I think the story is very relavant to youth and is an important part of the future of the Internet. Watching it gives people a bit more knowlege how it works and the people behind it.
