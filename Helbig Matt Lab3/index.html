	<h2>Career Goals</h2>

	<p>Why we do what we do: that moment when you get to see the future on your computer screen before the rest of the world. - Aaron Levie</p>

	<p>Many people spend a good majority of their lives trying to find out what they want to do for their careers. I've stuck with a similar set of ideas of what I wanted to do since my sheltered days in high school. Going into college, business and management was all I really wanted to learn more about. While other subjects interested me, none seemed as much fun as learning about the different aspects of a business.</p>

	<p>The one thing that changed for me was whom I would be working for. I assumed a large corporation or something would be good choice (as long as they are socially responsible and I believed in their products).</p>

	<p>After the launch of the first couple generations of the iPhone, I saw a ton of applications and services being introduced around that ecosystem. However, the people making these new things were not from corporations or small businesses like I saw when I was growing up; They were from something else entirely.</p>

	<p>My Junior year of college I was lucky enough to get an internship at Square. I was already an advocate for their product, so it seemed like a perfect fit. That's when I really started learning about what a "startup" was and the people behind those landing pages.</p>

	<p>Since then, I've been unbelievably lucky to work with various teams who have taught me a bunch. Over the last two years, it's been pretty apparent to me that I want to continue to work with startups. While most students are going to job fairs, I'm browsing AngelList and the "Who's Hiring?" posts on Hacker News.</p>

	<p>A job pays the bills; a career is a path towards increasingly better work; a calling is work that is an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity. - Jeff Haden</p>

	<p>My future job search seems very different than many of the other students that are graduating this year. I respect the corporate ladder journey, but it just doesn't seem the right fit for me.</p>

	<p>I hope in the next few months to find someplace to build something great with some amazing people. The world is not yet how I would like to see it, and I plan to spend time closing that gap.</p>

	<p>Maybe it's just for that brief glimpse of the future.</p>

	<h2>Hobbies/Interests</h2>

	<p>My hobbies and interests include a wide variety of things. I enjoy learning things from others, making things simple, and good craft beer.</p>

	<p>Hobbies of mine consist of working and trying to fulfill my hipster lifestyle. This includes listening to records, drinking direct-trade coffee, and looking at cats ironically online.</p> 

	<p>After watching some TED talks, I decided to organize one at DePaul. Recently, we sold out a 300 seat theater and had ten speakers. I also enjoy writing blog posts in Markdown and looking for interesting uses of CSS, responsive nav bars, and flat website design.</p>
